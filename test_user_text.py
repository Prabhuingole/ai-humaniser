In the farthest corner sat a small, teakwood chest that had belonged to his grandmother. He ran a hand over its carved lid, the wood warm and smooth beneath his calloused fingers. Inside, nestled amongst yellowed silk sarees and a pouch of defunct coins, was a small, exquisitely carved wooden bird. It was a bulbul, its head cocked inquisitively, its wooden feathers rendered with impossible detail. At its base was a small, brass winding key."""
